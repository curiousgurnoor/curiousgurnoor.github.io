                  curiosity is the engine of achievement. it's what drives us to ask "why?" and "what if?" even when the answers might challenge our existing beliefs. everyday is a learning and examination day, where remaining hungry allows you to continue learning without your ego clouding potential growth. you don't knwo what you don't know.

                 hard work is a baseline requirement to achieve what you want, but there is no point placing yourself under pressure. trust that working hard and remaining aligned to your goals will help you get there.

                 we exist as humans for a very short time. why should we spend that time fighting or living under pressure? From Guru Nanak, We humans exist for one breath at a time, not knowing (allotted time of) the life span or even what will happen next.
